Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is an enthusiastic Project Manager who needs to plan resources based on instructions from a Tech Architect. They want to dynamically plan agent lists for tasks as per the technical approach, listing agent names, roles, and task assignments in bullet points broken into phases. 

First, I need to figure out the different phases the project might go through. Common phases in software development are Requirements Gathering and Design, Architecture and Planning, Development, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. That makes sense.

Now, assigning the right people to each phase. Let's start with the first phase. A Tech Architect would lead design here, maybe working with a UI/UX Designer for front-end stuff. DevOps might not be needed here, but perhaps later. The key is to make sure each phase has the right people. 

In the Architecture phase, the Tech Architect would define the architecture, and a DB Architect would design the database. DevOps might set up CI/CD pipelines early. For Development, splitting into Frontend and Backend makes sense, with the Fullstack person maybe helping out both sides or handling integration. 

Testing phase: obviously the Tester, but also the DevOps for infrastructure testing. The DB Architect would test database performance. In Deployment, DevOps leads deployment, Tester checks post-deployment, Fullstack and Backend for final integration. 

Maintenance: DevOps for monitoring, Tester for regression, all developers for updates. 

Wait, maybe the roles in each phase need to be specific. The user mentioned a UI/UX Designer, so in Design they should be leading user research and flow. The Tester might only come in later, but maybe during Development for unit testing? Hmm. 

Also, the user wants the agents list dynamically planned, so each phase has necessary roles without repetition if possible. Maybe mention the key roles for each phase without overlapping. Need to check each phase's unique requirements. 

I should structure each phase with bullet points, list roles and tasks. Keep it conversational, no JSON. Let me review the roles again to make sure they fit each phase. Maybe the Testers come in during Development and Testing phases. 

Okay, final check: Phases are Requirements Gathering, Design, Architecture, Development (split into Frontend, Backend, Fullstack), Testing, Deployment, Maintenance. Each phase has relevant roles assigned. Names are as given. Tasks are specific to the phase. That should cover it.
