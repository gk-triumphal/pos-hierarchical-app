Okay, let's see. The user wants a Project Manager to plan resources based on instructions from the Tech Architect. The main task is to assign agents for different tasks dynamically across phases. The agents listed are a UI/UX Designer, Fullstack, Frontend, Backend, DB Architect, DevOps, and Tester. The output should be a conversational text with bullet points for phases, no JSON.

First, I need to understand the project phases typical for a software development project. Usually, there's Requirements Gathering, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. Each phase requires different roles.

In Requirements Gathering, the Tech Architect would probably lead, so maybe the Tech Architect isn't listed in the agents but is part of the instruction source. The initial phase might involve the Project Manager, Tech Architect, UI/UX Designer, and DevOps. The Project Manager would coordinate, Tech Architect define tech specs, UI/UX gather user requirements, and DevOps prepare cloud resources.

Next, Design Phase. UI/UX Designer creates mockups, Fullstack helps with architecture. The Project Manager oversees. Maybe Backend gets involved in API design here. Wait, the user didn't mention a Backend dev in the first phase. Hmm. The initial plan says for each phase which agents are assigned. So in Design Phase, UI/UX Designer, Fullstack, DB Architect, Project Manager. Backend might come in later.

Development Phase would split into Frontend and Backend. So Frontend dev, Backend dev, Fullstack, Tester. Fullstack might coordinate. The DevOps could be in Deployment phase instead.

Testing Phase is Tester leading with UI/UX, Backend, Fullstack for testing different areas.

Deployment Phase involves DevOps, DB Architect, Backend, Frontend for deployment steps.

Maintenance would have Tester, DevOps, Tech Architect for monitoring and fixing issues.

I need to make sure each agent is assigned to the right phase. Also, check if the roles are correctly assigned. The user listed 1 UI/UX Designer, 1 Fullstack, 1 Frontend, 1 Backend, 1 DB Architect, 1 DevOps, 1 Tester. So each role is a single person.

Now, structuring this with bullet points under each phase. Avoid using markdown, just conversational text with bullet points. Make sure each phase has the right agents listed with their roles. Let me cross-validate. Maybe in Development Phase, Fullstack coordinates with Frontend and Backend. Tester does parallel testing. Makes sense.

Also, in Testing Phase, Tester focuses on test cases, UI/UX ensures user testing, Backend tests APIs, Fullstack handles integration. Then Deployment relies on DevOps for deployment, DB Architect ensures backups, Backend handles API deployment, Frontend checks user access.

Maintenance is about monitoring, bug fixes, security updates. Tester and DevOps for that. Maybe Tech Architect is there for scaling. The user didn't mention scaling, but it's a common task. Wait, the original plan includes Tech Architect in Maintenance. But the user's listed agents might not include that. The user mentioned the Project Manager gets instruction from Tech Architect, so maybe Tech Architect is separate. The user's list includes UI/UX Designer, etc., but maybe Tech Architect is a separate role not listed in the agents. Need to check.

Original instruction: "As enthusiastic Project Manager, get instruction from Tech Architect. Plan resources..." So Tech Architect is involved, but the agents to plan are the ones listed. So Tech Architect isn't part of the agents to plan but gives instructions. So in the phases, maybe the Tech Architect is referenced as giving instructions, but the agents are the ones listed. So for example, in Requirements Gathering, the Tech Architect would define specs, but the Tech Architect isn't part of the agents to plan. That's correct.

Thus, the agents are the ones specified. So in the first phase, when the Tech Architect is involved, it's part of their role but not counted as an agent. So the agents for Requirements Gathering would be Project Manager (self?), Tech Architect (but not in the agents list), so maybe the Tech Architect is external. So for the project phases, when listing the agents, they would be from the provided list. So the initial phase's agents would be Project Manager (the person), UI/UX Designer, DevOps Engineer, maybe Fullstack. Wait, the Project Manager is part of the instruction but not in the agents to plan. The user didn't mention a specific Project Manager resource, just the list of agents. So perhaps the Project Manager is the one planning, and the Tech Architect is giving instructions. The agents to be assigned are the ones listed. So in the project phases, the actual roles are the listed agents.

So in the Requirements Gathering phase, maybe the Tech Architect is not among the agents. So maybe UI/UX Designer is involved in gathering user requirements, but the Tech Architect would define technical specs. However, the agents listed don't include the Tech Architect, so the Tech Architect's role is separate. Therefore, the Project Manager is coordinating, and the Tech Architect is providing instructions. Therefore, during Requirements Gathering, the agents would be UI/UX Designer (to gather user needs), possibly the Fullstack to understand technical feasibility, but that might be in another phase. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the user expects the Tech Architect to be part of the phases? The initial instruction says "get instruction from Tech Architect," but when planning the agents, the listed roles are the ones to assign. So Tech Architect gives instructions, but the actual agents are the ones in the list. So the project phases will use the agents from the given list.

Thus, in the Requirements Gathering phase, the Project Manager coordinates with the Tech Architect (external), but the agents assigned would be the ones listed. So perhaps UI/UX Designer gathers user requirements, DevOps sets up cloud environments, etc. The Tech Architect's role is to provide direction but isn't an assigned agent here.

So, structuring the phases with the given agents. Need to ensure that each phase uses the correct agents. Let me outline the phases again:

1. Requirements Gathering: Project Manager, UI/UX Designer, DevOps.
2. Design Phase: UI/UX Designer, Fullstack, DB Architect, Project Manager.
3. Development Phase: Fullstack (coordinates), Frontend, Backend, Tester.
4. Testing Phase: Tester, UI/UX Designer, Backend, Fullstack.
5. Deployment Phase: DevOps, DB Architect, Backend, Frontend.
6. Maintenance Phase: Tester, DevOps, UI/UX Designer (if updates needed), etc.

Wait, in the initial problem, the agents to plan are: UI/UX Designer, Fullstack, Frontend dev, Backend dev, DB Architect, DevOps, Tester. So the Project Manager is not among them. So perhaps the Project Manager is not listed as an agent but is coordinating the agents. Therefore, in the phases, the Project Manager is mentioned as coordinating but not as an agent. The actual agents are the ones listed.

But in the user's example response, they included the Project Manager as part of each phase. Maybe the Project Manager is part of the process. The user's example shows the Project Manager in each phase. So perhaps the Project Manager is included in each bullet point as part of the coordination.

Therefore, in each phase, the agents listed include the roles from the provided list plus the Project Manager. So the Project Manager is there, coordinating with the agents from the list. The Tech Architect is giving instructions but not part of the agents. The user might expect the Project Manager to be part of the process but not an agent to assign resources to. Wait, the user's instruction is to "plan resources" which are the listed roles. So the Project Manager is the one doing the planning, not a resource to be planned. Therefore, the project phases would involve the Project Manager coordinating, but the resources are the agents listed.

So, the first phase: Project Manager coordinates with Tech Architect (external), and assigns the agents from the list. The agents involved in the first phase would be UI/UX Designer (gather user requirements), DevOps (set up cloud environment). The Fullstack or DB Architect might not be needed in this phase.

Second phase: Design Phase, involving UI/UX Designer (create mockups), Fullstack (define architecture), DB Architect (define DB schema), Project Manager (oversees).

Third phase: Development splits into Frontend and Backend, with Fullstack coordinating. Tester does parallel testing.

Fourth phase: Testing with Tester leading, with UI/UX for user interface, Backend for APIs, Fullstack for integration.

Fifth phase: Deployment by DevOps, DB Architect for DB setup, Backend for API, Frontend for user access.

Sixth phase: Maintenance by Tester and DevOps for monitoring, UI/UX for new updates, Tech Architect for scaling (but not in agents).

I need to present this in a conversational tone, bullet points for each phase, agent names, roles, tasks. Let me structure that now.
