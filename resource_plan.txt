Okay, let me see. The user wants a Project Manager to plan resources and agents dynamically based on a Tech Architect's instructions. The resources given are 1 UI/UX Designer, 1 Fullstack, 1 Frontend dev, 1 Backend dev, 1 DB Architect, 1 DevOps, and 1 Tester. They need the agents listed with roles and tasks in bullet points per phase, no JSON.

First, I need to break down the project into phases. Common phases are Discovery, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance. For each phase, assign the right agents. Let me map each role to their tasks.

UI/UX Designer should be involved in the Design phase and maybe later for feedback. Fullstack could own the Development phase. Frontend and Backend handle their respective parts under Development. DB Architect is in the Backend. DevOps would handle Deployment and maybe setup. Tester is in Testing but should also check in other phases for quality.

Wait, the Fullstack developer might overlap with Frontend and Backend. Do I need to mention all three? Or is the Fullstack covering both? The user listed separate roles: Fullstack, Frontend, Backend. So perhaps the Fullstack is a senior dev who can do both but might need separate for specialized tasks. Maybe split tasks between Frontend and Backend under Fullstack's guidance?

DevOps is responsible for environment setup, CI/CD, deployment. They should also monitor after deployment. Tester not only tests but also validates during each dev phase.

Maintenance phase includes hotfixes, monitoring. DevOps and Tester might stay here. Tester could also validate maintenance updates.

Need to ensure each phase has necessary roles. Let me outline each phase and assign the agents with their tasks. Make sure no phase is missing a critical role, and each agent's role is clear.

**Phase 1: Discovery & Requirements**  
- **Tech Architect**: Finalize technical approach, stack, and dependencies.  
- **Fullstack Developer**: Validate architecture feasibility and propose integrations.  
- **Tester**: Identify potential QA requirements early (e.g., edge cases).  

**Phase 2: UI/UX Design & Prototyping**  
- **UI/UX Designer**: Create wireframes, prototypes, and interaction flows.  
- **Frontend Developer**: Collaborate on prototyping for real-time design feedback.  
- **DevOps**: Set up design tools and cloud-based collaboration environments.  

**Phase 3: Backend & Database Development**  
- **Backend Developer**: Build APIs, authentication, and core business logic.  
- **DB Architect**: Design DB schema, optimize queries, and enforce data governance.  
- **Fullstack Developer**: Integrate backend modules and validate data flows.  
- **DevOps**: Provision staging environments and automate DB backups.  

**Phase 4: Frontend Development**  
- **Frontend Developer**: Develop user-facing components, ensuring responsiveness.  
- **UI/UX Designer**: Conduct usability testing and refine interactions.  
- **Fullstack Developer**: Coordinate backend-frontend API integrations.  
- **Tester**: Perform unit testing on frontend logic.  

**Phase 5: System Testing & Debugging**  
- **Tester**: Execute end-to-end testing, performance, and security checks.  
- **DevOps**: Monitor logs, identify deployment bottlenecks, and stress-test systems.  
- **DB Architect**: Audit DB performance and optimize indexes.  
- **Fullstack Developer**: Debug critical issues across stack layers.  

**Phase 6: Deployment & Launch**  
- **DevOps**: Deploy code to production, manage blue/green staging.  
- **Tester**: Validate post-deployment stability and user acceptance.  
- **Frontend Developer**: Ensure cross-browser/mobile compatibility.  
- **Backend Developer**: Monitor API logs and resolve runtime errors.  

**Phase 7: Maintenance & Optimization**  
- **DevOps**: Monitor analytics, automate scaling, and manage CI/CD pipelines.  
- **DB Architect**: Schedule DB maintenance and ensure redundancy.  
- **Tester**: Create regression test suites for future updates.  
- **UI/UX Designer**: Gather user feedback for iterative design improvements.
