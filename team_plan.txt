Okay, let's break down the user's query. They want me to act as a Team Lead who receives agent lists and tasks from a Project Manager. The tasks involve creating agents dynamically based on a plan, reviewing their work, coordinating sub-agents for each task, and outputting conversational text with bullet points for phases.

First, I need to understand the structure of the phases. The user mentioned phases with bullet points, so each phase should have a clear title and steps. The first phase is about receiving the task from the Project Manager. I should note that I'll get the agent list and tasks, maybe the plan. Then, I need to create agents dynamically. That involves defining names, models, and prompts based on the plan provided.

Next, there's the coordination part. For each task, I might need to assign sub-agents. How do I structure that? Each main task could have a lead agent and specific sub-agents handling different aspects. Also, the review process is important—after agents create their deliverables, I should review them, provide feedback, and report back to the Project Manager.

I should make sure the output is in conversational text with bullet points, no JSON. So, after outlining the phases, each step should be clear and concise. Let me start drafting each phase.

Phase 1: Receiving the task. The Project Manager sends the list and tasks. I'll need to outline what info is received. Phase 2: Creating agents dynamically. Here, I'll explain how agents are named (based on their role), which models they use, and their prompts. Phase 3: Coordination of sub-agents. Maybe for each task, split into sub-agents handling specific parts. Phase 4: Reviewing and reporting. Check the work, give feedback, compile reports.

Wait, the user mentioned "for each piece, coordinate sub-agents." That might mean that each task (piece) has multiple sub-agents working on parts. So, in phase 3, I need to specify that for each task, I assign sub-agents.

Also, models and prompts. The models could be specific LLMs like GPT-4o for some, Claude for others. Prompts tailored to the role, like analytical for data, creative for content, etc.

I need to ensure the bullets are clear, and the phases flow logically. Let me structure each phase with bullet points under them. Avoid using markdown. Use simple language. Maybe start with:

As Team Lead:

Phase 1: Receiving Tasks
- Get agent list/tasks from PM.
- Review plan details.

Phase 2: Creating Agents
- Define agents' names based on roles.
- Assign models suitable for tasks.
- Create prompts tailored to each role.

Phase 3: Coordinating Sub-agents
- For each task, assign sub-agents.
- Distribute sub-tasks among sub-agents.
- Ensure collaboration and clarity.

Phase 4: Reviewing and Reporting
- Review deliverables.
- Provide feedback to agents.
- Compile and report to PM.

That's a rough outline. Now, fill in each section with more details. For example, in Phase 3, maybe give an example of a task and the sub-agents involved. Also, in Phase 2, specify examples of agent names and models. Need to make sure the language is conversational and not too technical. Avoid JSON, just plain text with bullets. Let me put it all together now.

As Team Lead:  
Here’s how we’ll structure the process:  

---  
**Phase 1: Receiving Task Plan from Project Manager**  
- Receive agent list and task assignments (e.g., data analysis, content creation, QA).  
- Review the project plan to identify key milestones, agent roles, and dependencies.  
- Confirm understanding with the Project Manager and ask clarifying questions if needed.  

**Phase 2: Dynamically Creating Agents**  
- **Names:** Assign agent names based on their specialized role (e.g., `DataAnalyzer_01`, `ContentWriter_Creative`).  
- **Models:** Select appropriate AI models (e.g., GPT-4o for content, Claude 3 for technical analysis) aligned with task complexity.  
- **Prompts:** Design role-specific prompts to guide outputs (e.g., "Analyze data trends with clear visualization suggestions").  

**Phase 3: Coordinating Sub-agents for Each Task**  
- **Example Task:** "Generate a product launch strategy with market analysis and user personas."  
  - **Sub-agents:**  
    - `MarketResearcher`: Uses a model for data mining and competitive intelligence.  
    - `PersonaGenerator`: Focused on creative persona development with structured outputs.  
    - `Synthesizer`: Aggregates inputs into a cohesive strategy document.  
- Ensure sub-agents collaborate via shared context or handoffs.  

**Phase 4: Reviewing Outputs and Reporting**  
- Review each agent’s deliverable for alignment with the plan.  
- Provide feedback (e.g., "Persona Generator needs to include age demographics").  
- Summarize progress in a report to the Project Manager, flagging risks or delays.
