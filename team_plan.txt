Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a Team Lead and outline the process of getting agent lists or tasks from a Project Manager, then create agents dynamically based on a plan. Then review their work and report back, coordinating sub-agents for each task. They want a conversational text with bullet points for phases, no JSON.

First, I need to break this down into phases. Let me start with Phase 1: Receiving the plan from the Project Manager. So, the Team Lead gets the task list and project plan. That makes sense. Need to make sure to clarify the scope, maybe ask questions if something's unclear.

Next, Phase 2: Creating agents dynamically. That means generating agent names, choosing models, and setting prompts based on the plan. For example, if the project is about data analysis, maybe create an agent called DataAnalyzer. But how do I decide on the models? Well, the user might have preferred models, but since it's dynamic, maybe selecting based on the task type. For prompts, tailor each to the task‚Äîthey need to be clear and focused.

Then, Phase 3: Coordinating sub-agents per task. So, each main task has sub-agents working on parts of it. For instance, if the main task is market research, sub-agents could be MarketAnalyzer and CompetitorReporter. Here, I need to define dependencies or workflows between sub-agents. Also, assign priorities and deadlines.

Phase 4: Monitoring and Review. The Team Lead needs to check each agent's output. If issues arise, maybe re-prompt or adjust the model. Then compile the results and report progress to the Project Manager. This phase should include feedback loops for adjustments.

Phase 5: Reporting to the Project Manager. Summarize each task's status, highlight any risks or achievements. Get feedback for the next phase. It's important to make the report concise but informative.

I need to present this in a conversational list without JSON, using bullet points. Let me structure each phase step by step. Make sure each phase has clear actions and outcomes. Use examples where possible, like agent names and tasks. Avoid technical jargon unless necessary. Keep the flow logical from receiving the plan to final reporting. Also, ensure that coordination with sub-agents is highlighted as a key part of each task. Maybe mention how agents communicate among themselves to maintain consistency.

Wait, the user mentioned "coordinate sub-agents for each piece." Maybe in Phase 3, clarify that each piece (task) has sub-agents, and the coordination involves how they interact. Also, in Phase 4, when reviewing agents' work, mention specific actions like checking accuracy and relevance. Need to ensure that the process is dynamic‚Äîlike if a problem arises, the Team Lead adjusts the approach.

Let me check if I covered all parts of the original request: get tasks from PM, create agents, review and report, coordinate sub-agents, and output in bullet points with phases. Yes, each phase addresses these. Examples like agent names and models (e.g., GPT for content) help illustrate the dynamic part.

I should avoid any markdown, just plain text with bullet points and phases numbered. Make sure it's conversational, maybe start with "As Team Lead,". Let me start drafting.

As Team Lead:  

**Phase 1: Receiving the Plan**  
- Retrieve the agent list and project tasks from the Project Manager.  
- Clarify the scope, deadlines, and key deliverables. Ask questions to resolve ambiguities in the plan.  

**Phase 2: Dynamically Creating Agents**  
- Define agent names, models, and prompts based on the project‚Äôs needs. For example:  
   - **Agent Name:** DataAnalyzer  
   - **Model:** GPT-x for complexity, Mistral for speed.  
   - **Prompt:** ‚ÄúPrioritize root-cause analysis for discrepancies in sales data.‚Äù  
- Assign each agent a specific role aligned with their purpose (e.g., Task Orchestrator, Content Validator).  

**Phase 3: Coordinating Sub-Agents per Task**  
- For every main task, break it into subtasks and assign sub-agents:  
   Example Task: *Market Research Report*  
   - Sub-Agents: MarketAnalyzer (gathers trends), CompetitorReporter (compares benchmarks).  
- Define workflows (e.g., MarketAnalyzer > CompetitorReporter > SummaryWriter).  
- Set dependencies (e.g., SummaryWriter waits for inputs from both sub-agents).  

**Phase 4: Monitoring & Review**  
- Check outputs from agents for accuracy, relevance, and alignment with the plan.  
   - Example: If DataAnalyzer flags an error, re-prompt it with: ‚ÄúRe-analyze using 2023 Q1-Q2 benchmarks.‚Äù  
- Compile results into structured summaries. Escalate critical issues to the Project Manager.  

**Phase 5: Reporting to the Project Manager**  
- Deliver progress updates with:  
   - ‚úÖ Tasks completed (list + results).  
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks (e.g., delay in CompetitorReporter output).  
   - üìà Key insights (e.g., top 3 market trends).  
- Adjust the plan based on feedback (e.g., prioritize high-impact tasks or reassign underperforming agents).
